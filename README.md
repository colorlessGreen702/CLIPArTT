# CLIPArTT

Official repository of the ****** paper "CLIPArTT: Light-weight Adaptation of CLIP to New Domains at Test Time", by Gustavo A. Vargas Hakim, David Osowiechi, Mehrdad Noori, Milad Cheraghalikhani, Ali Bahri, Moslem Yazdanpanah, Ismail Ben Ayed, and Christian Desrosiers.
The whole article can be found [here](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/******.html).
This work was greatly inspired by the code in [NC-TTT](https://github.com/GustavoVargasHakim/NCTTT.git) and [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git).

We propose a novel unsupervised TTA technique .
